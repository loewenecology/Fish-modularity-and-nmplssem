# Fish-modularity-and-nmplssem

Processed data and code for conducting bipartite network modularity analysis and analyzing modules by non-metric partial least-squares structural equation models paired with multiple logistic regression under a variation partitioning framework.

sitemodenv.csv contains site modules and derived spatial and environmental indicator variables. Indicator variables are Reg_hab_dens (Regional habitat density), Riv_net_disp_dist (River network dispersal distance), Glac_lake_marine_dist (Glacial lake/marine distance), Time_since_glac (Time since glaciation), Surface_area (Surface area), Max_depth (Maximum depth), Secchi_depth (Secchi depth), Prop_shield_litho (Proportion shield lithology), Clim_MWMT (Mean warmest month temperature), Clim_MCMT (Mean coldest month temperature), Clim_MSP (May to September precipitation), and Clim_PAS (Precipitation as snow).

spmods.csv contains species modules.

Raw fish data (with species at risk removed for their protection) are available from the Dryad Digital Repository (doi). As contractual requirements prevent us from releasing detailed sampling records for Ontario directly, these data are provided with approximate location coordinates. The full set of fish data (including species at risk) are readily available for non-commercial purposes from the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources, and Forestry in Ontario (https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/aquatic-resource-area-polygon-segment-) and Departments of Natural Resources in Michigan (https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79137_79765_84005_84013---,00.html) and Minnesota (https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/waters/surfacewater_section/lake_ibi/index.html) through their standard data-sharing agreements.
